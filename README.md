# **Student Details Management System Documentation**

## **Introduction**
The Student Details Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of student and teacher information in an educational institution. Built using Flask (a Python web framework) and SQLite as the database, this system provides a user-friendly interface for teachers to manage student records and for students to access their own details. The project aims to address common challenges in manual record-keeping and enhance efficiency in educational administration.
________________________________________
## **Problem Statement**
In traditional educational institutions, managing student and teacher details is often a manual process involving paper-based records or disparate software systems. This approach presents several challenges:

  •	**Inefficiency**: Manually updating and retrieving student information is time-consuming and prone to errors.
  
  •	**Lack of Accessibility**: Teachers cannot easily access or modify student’s records without administrative intervention, leading to delays.
  
  •	**Data Inconsistency**: Multiple records across different departments can result in discrepancies and outdated information.
  
  •	**Security Concerns**: Physical records are vulnerable to loss, theft, or damage, and digital solutions without proper authentication may expose sensitive data.
  
  •	**Limited Features**: Existing systems may not support advanced functionalities like attendance tracking or real-time updates.

The Student Details Management System addresses these issues by providing a centralized, secure, and automated platform to manage educational data efficiently.
